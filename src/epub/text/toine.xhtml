			<h2>Toine</h2>
			<h3>I</h3>
			<p>Old Toine was known for twenty miles around, fat Toine, Toine-ma-Fine, Antoine Mâcheblé, alias Brûlot, the innkeeper at Tournevent.</p>
			<p>He had made famous this hamlet, buried in the depths of the valley which ran down to the sea, a poor peasant hamlet, composed of a dozen Norman houses surrounded by ditches and trees. The houses were huddled together in this ravine, covered with grass and furze, behind the curve of the hill, which had given the village the name of Tournevant. As birds conceal themselves in the furrows during a storm, they seemed to have sought a shelter in this hollow, a shelter against the fierce salt winds of the sea, which gnawed and burned like fire, and withered and destroyed like the frosts of winter.</p>
			<p>The whole hamlet seemed to be the property of Antoine Mâcheblé, alias Brûlot, who was, besides, often called Toine, and Toine-ma-Fine, because of a phrase which he constantly used. “My <em>fine</em> is the best in France,” he would say. His <em>fine</em> was his cognac, be it understood. For twenty years he had soaked the countryside in his cognac, for, whenever his customers said: “Well, what is it going to be, my boy?” he invariably replied: “Try a brandy, old son. It warms the stomach and clears the head; there is nothing better for your health.” He called everybody “old son,” although he had never had a son of his own.</p>
			<p>Ah, yes, everyone knew old Toine, the biggest man in the district, or even in the country. His little house seemed too ridiculously small to contain him, and when he was seen standing in his doorway, where he spent the greater part of every day, one wondered how he could enter his home. But he did enter each time a customer presented himself, for Toine-ma-Fine was invited by right to levy a glass on all who drank in his house.</p>
			<p>His café bore on its sign the legend “The Rendezvous of Friends,” and old Toine was truly the friend of all the country round. People came from Fécamp and Montivilliers to see him and laugh at his stories⁠—for this great, good-natured man could bring a smile to the most solemn face. He had a way of joking without giving offence, of winking his eye to express what he dare not utter, and of slapping his thigh in his bursts of mirth which made one laugh in spite of oneself. And then it was a curiosity just to see him drink. He drank all that was offered him by everybody, with a joy in his wicked eye, a joy which came from a double pleasure: first, the pleasure of regaling himself, and then the pleasure of heaping up money at the expense of his friends.</p>
			<p>The local wits would ask:</p>
			<p>“Tell us now, Toine. Why don’t you drink up the sea?”</p>
			<p>And he would reply:</p>
			<p>“There are two objections. First, it is salty, and second, it would have to be bottled; my paunch prevents me from stooping down to that cup.”</p>
			<p>The quarrels of Toine and his wife were Homeric! It was such a good show that one would have paid to see it. They had squabbled every day through the whole thirty years of their married life. Only Toine was good-natured over it, while his wife was furious. She was a tall peasant woman who walked with long stilt-like strides, her thin, flat body surmounted by the head of an ugly screech-owl. She spent her whole time in rearing poultry in the little yard behind the inn, and was renowned for the success with which she fattened her fowls.</p>
			<p>When any of the great ladies of Fécamp gave a feast to the people of quality, it was necessary to the success of the repast that it should be garnished with the celebrated fowls from mother Toine’s poultry-yard.</p>
			<p>But she was born with a vile temper and had continued to be dissatisfied with everything. Angry with everybody, she was particularly so with her husband. She jeered at his gaiety, his popularity, his good health, and his fatness; she treated him with the utmost contempt because he got his money without working for it, and because, as she said, he ate and drank as much as ten ordinary men. Not a day passed without her declaring, in exasperated tones: “Wouldn’t a hog like that be better in the sty with the pigs! He’s that fat, it makes me sick in the stomach.” “Wait a little, wait a little,” she would shriek in his face, “we shall soon see what is going to happen! This great windbag will burst like a sack of grain!”</p>
			<p>Toine laughed, tapping his enormous belly, and replied: “Ah, old skinny, let us see you try to make your chickens as fat as this.”</p>
			<p>And rolling up his sleeve he showed his brawny arm. “There’s a wing for you!” he would cry. And the customers would strike their fists on the table and fairly writhe with joy, and stamp their feet and spit upon the floor in a delirium of delight.</p>
			<p>The old woman grew more furious than ever, and shouted at the top of her lungs: “Just wait a bit, we shall see what will happen. You will burst like a sack of grain.”</p>
			<p>And she rushed out, maddened with rage at the laughter of the crowd of drinkers.</p>
			<p>Toine, in fact, was a wonder to see, so fat and red and short of breath had he grown. He was one of those enormous creatures with whom Death seems to play, with tricks, and jokes, and treacherous buffooneries, making irresistibly comic the slow work of destruction. Instead of behaving as he did towards others, showing the white hairs, shrunken limbs, wrinkles, and general feebleness which makes one say with a shiver: “Heavens, how he has changed!” Death took pleasure in fattening Toine; in making a droll monster of him, in reddening his face and giving him the appearance of superhuman health; and the deformities which he inflicted on others became in Toine’s case laughable and diverting instead of sinister and pitiable.</p>
			<p>“Wait a little, wait a little,” muttered mother Toine, as she scattered the grain about her poultryyard, “you will see what will happen!”</p>
			<h3>II</h3>
			<p>It happened that Toine had a seizure, and fell down with a paralytic stroke. They carried the giant to the little chamber partitioned off at the rear of the café in order that he might hear what was going on on the other side of the wall, and converse with his friends, for his brain remained clear while his enormous body was prone and helpless. They hoped for a time that his mighty limbs would recover some of their energy, but this hope disappeared very soon, and Toine was forced to pass his days and nights in his bed, which was made up but once a week, with the help of four friends who lifted him by his four limbs while his mattress was turned. He continued to be cheerful, but with a different kind of good humour; more timid, more humble, and with the pathetic fear of a little child in the presence of his wife, who scolded and raged all the day long. “There he lies, the boozer, the good-for-nothing, the idler!” she cried. Toine replied nothing, only winking his eye behind the old woman’s back, and turned over in the bed, the only movement he was able to make. He called this change “making a move to the north, or a move to the south.” His only entertainment now was to listen to the conversation in the café and to join in the talk across the wall, and when he recognized the voice of a friend he would cry: “Hello, old son; is that you, Célestin?”</p>
			<p>And Célestin Maloisel would reply: “It is me, father Toine. How are the legs today, my boy?”</p>
			<p>“I can’t run yet, Célestin,” Toine would an swer, “but I am not growing thin, either. The shell is good.” Soon he invited his intimates into his bedroom for company, because it pained him to see them drinking without him. He would say: “Boys, what knocks me is not to be able to have a glass. I don’t care a hoot about anything else, but it’s terrible not to drink.”</p>
			<p>Then the screech-owl’s head of mother Toine would appear at the window, and she would cry: “Look, look at him! this great hulking idler, who must be fed and washed and scoured like a pig!”</p>
			<p>And when she disappeared a red-plumaged rooster sometimes perched on the windowsill, and, looking about with his round and curious eye, gave forth a shrill crow. And sometimes two or three hens flew in and scratched and pecked about the floor, attracted by the crumbs which fell from father Toine’s plate.</p>
			<p>The friends of Toine-ma-Fine very soon deserted the café for his room, and every afternoon they gossiped around the bed of the big man. Bedridden as he was, this rascal Toine still amused them; he would have made the devil himself laugh, the jolly fellow! There were three friends who came every day: Célestin Maloisel, a tall, spare man with a body twisted like the trunk of an apple-tree; Prosper Horslaville, a little dried-up old man with a nose like a ferret, malicious and sly as a fox; and Césaire Paumelle, who never uttered a word, but who enjoyed himself all the same. They brought in a board from the yard which they placed across the bed and on which they played dominoes from two o’clock in the afternoon until six. But mother Toine soon interfered: she could not endure that her husband should amuse himself by playing dominoes in his bed, and, each time she saw the game begin, she bounded into the room in a rage, overturned the board, seized the dominoes, and carried them into the café, declaring that it was enough to feed this great lump of fat, without seeing him amuse himself at the expense of hardworking people. Célestin Maloisel bent his head before the storm, but Prosper Horslaville tried to further excite the old woman, whose rages amused him. Seeing her one day more exasperated than usual, he said: “Hello, mother Toine! Do you know what I would do if I were in your place?”</p>
			<p>She waited for an explanation, fixing her owl-like eyes upon him. He continued:</p>
			<p>“Your husband, who never leaves his bed, is as hot as an oven. I should set him to hatching out eggs.”</p>
			<p>She remained stupefied, thinking he was jesting, watching the thin, sly face of the peasant, who continued:</p>
			<p>“I would put five eggs under each arm the same day that I set the yellow hen; they would all hatch out at the same time; and when they were out of their shells, I would put your husband’s chicks under the hen for her to bring up. That would bring you some poultry, mother Toine.”</p>
			<p>The old woman was amazed. “Is it possible?” she asked.</p>
			<p>Prosper continued: “Why can’t it? Since they put eggs in a warm box to hatch, one might as well put them in a warm bed.”</p>
			<p>She was greatly impressed with this reasoning, and went out completely quieted down and thoughtful.</p>
			<p>Eight days later she came into Toine’s chamber with her apron full of eggs, and said: “I have just put the yellow hen to set with ten eggs under her; here are ten for you! Be careful not to break them!”</p>
			<p>Toine was astonished. “What do you mean?” he cried.</p>
			<p>“I mean that you shall hatch them, good-for-nothing.”</p>
			<p>Toine laughed at first, then as she insisted he grew angry, he resisted and obstinately refused to allow her to put the eggs under his great arms, that his warmth might hatch them. But the baffled old woman grew furious and declared: “You shall have not a bite to eat so long as you refuse to take them⁠—there, we’ll see what will happen!”</p>
			<p>Toine was uneasy, but he said nothing. When he heard the clock strike twelve he called to his wife: “Hey, Mother, is the soup ready?” The old woman shouted from the kitchen: “There is no dinner for you today, you lazy thing!”</p>
			<p>He thought at first she was joking, and waited. Then he begged and prayed and swore by fits; turned himself “to the north” and “to the south,” grew desperate under the pangs of hunger and the smell of the viands, and pounded on the wall with his great fists, until at last, worn out and almost famished, he allowed his wife to introduce the eggs into his bed and place them under his arms. After that he had his soup.</p>
			<p>When his friends arrived, they believed Toine to be very ill; he seemed constrained and uneasy.</p>
			<p>Then they began to play dominoes as formerly, but Toine appeared to take no pleasure in the game, and put forth his hand so gingerly and with such evident precaution that they suspected at once something was wrong.</p>
			<p>“Is your arm tied?” demanded Horslaville.</p>
			<p>Toine feebly responded: “I have a feeling of heaviness in my shoulder.”</p>
			<p>Suddenly someone entered the café, and the players paused to listen. It was the mayor and his assistant, who called for two glasses of cognac and then began to talk of the affairs of the country. As they spoke in low tones, Toine Brûlot tried to press his ear against the wall; and forgetting his eggs, he gave a sudden lunge “to the north,” which resulted in his lying down on an omelet. At the oath he uttered, mother Toine came running in, and divining the disaster she uncovered him with a jerk. She stood a moment too enraged and breathless to speak, at the sight of the yellow poultice pasted on the flank of her husband. Then, trembling with fury, she flung herself on the paralytic and began to pound him with great force on the body, as though she were pounding her dirty linen on the banks of the river. She showered her blows upon him with the force and rapidity of a drummer beating his drum.</p>
			<p>The friends of Toine were choking with laughter, coughing, sneezing, uttering exclamations, while the frightened man parried the attacks of his wife with due precaution in order not to break the five eggs he still had on the other side.</p>
			<h3>III</h3>
			<p>Toine was conquered. He was compelled to hatch eggs. He had to renounce the innocent pleasure of dominoes, to give up any effort to move, for his wife deprived him of all nourishment every time he broke an egg. He lay on his back, with his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his arms extended like wings, warming against his immense body the incipient chicks in their white shells. He spoke only in low tones as if he feared a noise as much as a movement, and he asked often about the yellow hen in the poultry-yard, who was engaged in the same task as himself.</p>
			<p>“Did the yellow one eat last night?” he would say to his wife.</p>
			<p>The old woman went from the hen to her husband, and from her husband to the hen, possessed and preoccupied with the little broods which were maturing in the bed and in the nest. The country people, who soon learned the story, came in, curious and serious, to get the news of Toine. They entered on tiptoe as one enters a sick-chamber, and inquired with concern:</p>
			<p>“How goes it, Toine?”</p>
			<p>“That’s all right,” he answered; “But it is so long, I get very hot. I feel cold shivers galloping all over my skin.”</p>
			<p>One morning his wife came in very much disturbed, and exclaimed: “The yellow hen has hatched seven chicks; there were but three bad eggs!”</p>
			<p>Toine felt his heart beat. How many would he have?</p>
			<p>“Will it be soon?” he asked, with the anguish of a woman who is about to become a mother.</p>
			<p>The old woman, who was tortured by the fear of failure, answered angrily:</p>
			<p>“It is to be hoped so!”</p>
			<p>They waited.</p>
			<p>The friends, seeing that Toine’s time was approaching, became very uneasy themselves. They gossiped about it in the house, and kept all the neighbours informed of the progress of affairs. Towards three o’clock Toine grew drowsy. He slept now half the time. He was suddenly awakened by an unusual tickling under his arm. He put his hand carefully to the place and seized a little beast covered with yellow down, which struggled between his fingers. His emotion was so great that he cried out and let go the chick, which ran across his breast. The café was full of people. The customers rushed into the room and circled round the bed, as if they were at a circus, while mother Toine, who had arrived at the first sound, carefully caught the fledgeling as it nestled in her husband’s beard. No one uttered a word. It was a warm April day; one could hear through the open window the clucking of the yellow hen calling to her new born. Toine, who perspired with emotion and agony, murmured: “I feel another one now under my left arm.”</p>
			<p>His wife plunged her great, gaunt hand under the bedclothes and drew forth a second chick with all the precautions of a midwife.</p>
			<p>The neighbours wished to see it and passed it from hand to hand, regarding it with awe as though it were a phenomenon. For the space of twenty minutes no more were hatched, then four chicks came out of their shells at the same time. This caused great excitement among the watchers.</p>
			<p>Toine smiled, happy at his success, and began to feel proud of this singular paternity. Such a sight had never been seen before. This was a droll man, truly! “That makes six,” cried Toine. “By heavens, what a christening there will be!” and a great laugh rang out from the public. Other people now crowded into the café and filled the doorway, with outstretched necks and curious eyes.</p>
			<p>“How many has he?” they inquired.</p>
			<p>“There are six.”</p>
			<p>Mother Toine ran with the new fledgelings to the hen, who, clucking distractedly, erected her feathers and spread wide her wings to shelter her increasing flock of little ones.</p>
			<p>“Here comes another one!” cried Toine. He was mistaken⁠—there were three of them. This was a triumph! The last one broke its shell at seven o’clock in the evening. All Toine’s eggs were good! He was delivered, and, delirious with joy, he seized and kissed the frail little creature on the back. He could have smothered it with caresses. He wished to keep this little one in his bed until the next day, moved by the tenderness of a mother for this being to whom he had given life; but the old woman carried it away, as she had done the others, without listening to the supplications of her husband.</p>
			<p>The spectators went home delighted, talking of the event by the way, and Horslaville, who was the last to leave, said: “You will invite me to the first fricassee, won’t you, Toine?”</p>
			<p>At the idea of a fricassee, Toine’s face brightened and he answered:</p>
			<p>“Certainly I will invite you, my son.”</p>
