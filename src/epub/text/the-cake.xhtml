<h2>The Cake</h2>
<p>We will call her Madame Anserre though it was not her real name.</p>
<p>She was one of those Parisian comets who leave a sort of trail of fire behind them. She wrote poetry and short stories, was sentimental and ravishingly beautiful. Her circle was small and consisted only of exceptional people &#8212; those generally known as the kings of this, that, or the other. To be invited to her receptions stamped one as a person of intelligence; let us say that her invitations were appreciated for this reason. Her husband played the part of an obscure satellite: to be married to a star is no easy r&#244;le. This husband had, however, a brilliant idea, that of creating a State within a State, of possessing some value in himself although only of secondary importance: he received on the same day as his wife did and had his special set who listened to him and appreciated his qualities, paying much more attention to him than they did to his brilliant companion.</p>
<hr/>
<p>He had devoted himself to agriculture, armchair&quot; agriculture, just as we have &quot;arm-chair generals—all those who are born, live, and die in the comfortable surroundings of the War Office—or &quot;arm-chair&quot; sailors look at the Admiralty—or &quot;arm-chair&quot; colonisers, etc., etc. So he had studied agriculture seriously in its relation to the other sciences, with political economy and with the fine arts; we call everything art, even the horrible railway bridges are &quot;works of art.&#39; He had finally reached the stage when he was known as a clever man, he was quoted in the technical reviews, and his wife had succeeded in getting him appointed a member of a Commission at the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p>He was satisfied with this modest glory. On the pretext of economy he invited his friends the same day his wife received hers, so that they all met each other, or rather they did not—they formed two groups. Madame&#39;s group of artists, academicians and Ministers gathered together in a kind of gallery which was furnished and decorated in Empire style. Monsieur generally retired with his &quot;labourers&quot; into a small room used as a smoking-room which Madame Anserre ironically described as the Salon of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The two camps were quite distinct. Monsieur, without any feeling of jealousy, sometimes ventured into the Academy, when cordial greetings were exchanged; but the Academy disdained intercourse with the Salon of Agriculture; it was indeed rare that one of the kings of science, of philosophy, of this, that, or the other mingled with the &quot;labourers.&quot;</p>
<p>These receptions were quite simple: nothing but tea and brioches were handed round. At first Monsieur had asked for two brioches, one for the Academy and one for the &quot;labourers,&quot; but, Madame having quite rightly suggested that that would be a recognition of two different camps, two receptions, two groups, Monsieur did not press the matter, so there was only one brioche, which Madame Anserre dis hind the husband, who was always smiling, and when Madame Anserre, in a state of anxiety, showed herself at the door, carrying the knife in one hand and the brioche in the other, they all gathered round her husband as if they were seeking his protection.</p>
<p>Some years passed and no one cut up the cake, but the old habit persisted and she who was still politely called &quot;the beautiful Madame Anserre&#8221; looked out each evening for some devotee to take the knife, and each time the same stampede took place: there was a general flight, cleverly arranged and full of combined and skilful manoeuvres to avoid the offer that was rising to her lips.</p>
<p>But, one evening, a boy—ignorant of the ways of the world and quite unsophisticated was introduced to the house. He knew nothing about the mystery of the brioche; therefore when it appeared and when the rest had all fled, and when Madame Anserre took the cake from the footman, he remained quietly by her side.</p>
<p>She may have thought that he knew all about it; she smiled and said in a voice full of feeling: &quot;Will you be so kind as to cut this brioche, dear Monsieur?&quot; Flattered at the honour, he replied: &quot;Certainly, Madame, with the greatest pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>In the distance—in the corners of the gallery, in the open doorway of the Salon of Agriculture amazed faces were looking at him. Then, when the spectators saw the new-comer cutting the cake, they quickly came forward. An old poet jokingly slapped the neophyte on the shoulder and whispered: &quot;Bravo, young man!&#8221;</p>
<p>The others gazed at him with curiosity and even</p>
<p>Monsieur appeared surprised. As for the young man, he was astonished at the consideration he met with; above all, he failed to understand the marked attentions, the conspicuous favour, and the speechless gratitude of the mistress of the house.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he eventually found out, though no one knew at what moment, in what place the revelation came to him, but when he appeared at the next reception he seemed preoccupied and half ashamed, and looked anxiously round the room. When the bell rang for tea and the footman appeared, Madame Anserre, with a smile, took the dish and looked round for her young friend, but he fled so precipitately that no trace of him could be found. Then she went off to look for him and discovered him at the end of the Salon of &quot;labourers&quot; holding her husband&#39;s arm tightly and consulting him in an agonised manner as to the best method of destroying phylloxera.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Monsieur, will you be so kind as to cut up this brioche?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>He blushed to the roots of his hair, stammered, and completely lost his head. Thereupon Monsieur Anserre took pity on him and, turning to his wife, said:</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, it would be kind of you not to disturb us. We are discussing agriculture. Let Baptiste cut up the cake.&quot;</p>
<p>Since that day no one has ever cut Madame Anserre&#39;s brioche.</p>
