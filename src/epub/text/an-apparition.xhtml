<h2>An Apparition</h2>
<p>We were speaking of sequestration &#224; propos of a recent lawsuit. It was at the close of an evening amongst friends, at an old house in the Rue de Grenelle, and each of us had a story to tell, a story alleged to be true. Then, the old Marquis de la Tour Samuel, who was eighty-two, rose, and, leaning on the mantelpiece, said, in somewhat shaky tones:</p>
<p>&quot;I also know something strange, so strange that it has been an obsession all my life. It is now fiftysix years since the incident occurred, and yet not a month has passed in which I have not seen it again in a dream. The mark, the imprint of fear, if you can understand me, has remained with me ever since that day. For ten minutes I experienced such horrible fright that, ever since, a sort of constant terror is in my soul. Unexpected noises make me shudder to the bottom of my soul and objects half-seen in the gloom of night inspire me with a mad desire to take flight. In short, at night I am afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, no! I would not have admitted that before having reached my present age! Now I can say anything. At eighty-two years of age, I do not feel compelled to be brave in the presence of imaginary dangers. I have never receded before real danger.</p>
<p>&quot;The affair upset me so completely, and caused me such deep and mysterious and terrible distress, that I never spoke of it to any one. I have kept it down in the depths of my being, in those depths where painful secrets are kept, the shameful secrets and all the unconfessed weaknesses of our lives. I will now tell it to you exactly as it happened, without any attempt at explanation. There is no doubt it can be explained, unless I was mad at the time. But I was not mad, and I will prove it. You may think what you like. Here are the simple facts:</p>
<p>&quot;It was in 1827, in the month of July. I was stationed at Rouen. One day, as I was walking along the quay, I met a man whom I thought I recognized, without being able to recall exactly who he was. Instinctively, I made a movement to stop; the stranger perceived it, looked at me, and fell into my arms.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a friend of my youth to whom I had been deeply attached. For five years I had not seen him, and he seemed to have aged half a century. His hair was quite white, and he walked with a stoop as though completely worn out. He understood my surprise, and told me his life. A misfortune had shattered it.</p>
<p>&quot;Having fallen madly in love with a young girl, he had married her, but, after a year of superhuman happiness and of passionate love, she died suddenly of heart failure, of love, very probably. He had left his ch&#226;teau on the very day of her burial and had come to live in his house at Rouen. There he lived, desperate and solitary, consumed by grief, and so miserable that he thought only of suicide.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that I have found you again,&#39; said he, &#8216;I will ask you to render me an important service, to go to my old home and get for me, from the desk of my bedroom- our bedroom-some papers which I greatly need. I cannot send a servant or a lawyer, as complete discretion and absolute silence are necessary. As for myself, nothing on earth would induce me to re-enter that house. I will give you the key of the room, which I myself locked on leaving, and the key of my desk—also a note to my gardener, telling him to open the ch&#226;teau for you. But come and breakfast with me to-morrow, and we will arrange all that.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;I promised to do him the slight favour he asked. For that matter, it was nothing of a trip, his property being but a few miles distant from Rouen and easily reached in an hour on horseback.</p>
<p>&quot;At ten o&#39;clock the following day I was at his house, and we breakfasted alone together, but he scarcely spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;He begged me to pardon him; the thought of the visit I was about to make to that room, the scene of his dead happiness, overwhelmed him, he said. He, indeed, seemed singularly agitated and preoccupied, as though some mysterious struggle were taking place in his soul.</p>
<p>&quot;At last, he explained to me exactly what I had to do. It was very simple. I was to take two packages of letters and a roll of papers from the first drawer on the right of the desk of which I had the key. He added, &#39;I need not beg you to refrain from glancing at them.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;I was wounded at that remark, and told him so somewhat sharply. He stammered, &#39;Forgive me, I suffer so,&#39; and he began to weep.</p>
<p>&quot;I took leave of him about one o&#39;clock to accomplish my mission.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather was glorious, and I cantered over the fields, listening to the songs of the larks and the rhythmical striking of my sword against my boot. Then I entered the forest and walked my horse. Branches of trees caressed my face as I passed, and, now and then, I caught a leaf with my teeth, and chewed it greedily, from that sheer joy of living which inexplicably fills one with a sense of tumultuous, impalpable happiness, a sort of intoxication of strength.</p>
<p>&quot;As I approached the ch&#226;teau, I looked in my pocket for the letter I had for the gardener, and was astonished at finding it sealed. I was so surprised and irritated that I was about to turn back without having fulfilled my promise but thought that I should thereby display undue susceptibility. My friend might easily have closed the envelope without noticing that he did so, in his troubled state of mind.</p>
<p>&quot;The manor seemed to have been abandoned for twenty years. The gate was open and in such a state of decay that one wondered how it stood upright; the paths were overgrown with grass, and the flower beds were no longer distinguishable from the lawn.</p>
<p>&quot;The noise I made by tapping loudly on a shutter brought an old man from a side door, who seemed stunned with astonishment at seeing me. On receiving my letter, he read it, re-read it, turned it over and over, looked me up and down, put the paper in his pocket, and finally asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Well! what is it you want?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;I replied shortly: &#39;You ought to know, since you have just read your master&#39;s orders. I wish to enter the ch&#226;teau.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;Then you are going</p>
<p>&quot;I began to lose patience: &#39;See here! Do you propose to cross-examine me?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;He stammered in confusion: &#39;No—sir—but it is because &#8212; that is, it has not been opened since since the death. If you will be kind enough to wait for five minutes, I will go to to see if -&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;I interrupted him, angrily: &#39;Look here, what are you driving at? You cannot enter the room, since I have the key!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;He had no more to say. &#39;Then, sir, I will show you the way.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Show me the staircase and leave me. I&#39;ll find my way without you.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir indeed &#8212;&#39;</p>
<p>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;</p>
<p>&quot;This time I became really angry: &#39;Now be quiet or you&#39;ll know the reason why.&#39; I pushed him aside, and went into the house.</p>
<p>&quot;He seemed overcome. into... into her room?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;I first went through the kitchen; then two rooms occupied by the servant and his wife; next, by a wide hall, I reached the stairs, which I mounted, and recognized the door indicated by my friend.</p>
<p>&quot;I easily opened it and entered. The apartment was so dark that, at first, I could distinguish nothing. I stopped short, my nostrils penetrated by the disagreeable, mouldy odour of unoccupied rooms, of dead rooms. Then, as my eyes slowly became accustomed to the darkness, I saw plainly enough, a large and disordered bedroom, the bed without sheets, but still retaining its mattresses and pillows, on one of which was a deep impression of an elbow or a head, as though some one had recently rested there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chairs all seemed out of place. I noticed that a door, doubtless that of a closet, had remained half open.</p>
<p>&quot;I first went to the window, which I opened to let in the light; but the fastenings of the shutters had grown so rusty that I could not move them. I even tried to break them with my sword, but without success. As I was growing irritated over my useless efforts, and could now see fairly well in the semiobscurity, I renounced the idea of getting more light and went over to the writing-table.</p>
<p>&quot;I sat down in an arm-chair, let down the lid of the desk and opened the drawer that had been indicated. It was full to the top. I needed only three packages, which I knew how to recognize, and began searching for them.</p>
<p>&quot;I was straining my eyes in the effort to read the superscriptions, when I seemed to hear, or rather feel, something rustle behind me. I paid no attention, believing that a draught from the window was moving some drapery. But, in a minute or so, another movement, almost imperceptible, sent a strangely disagreeable little shiver over my skin. It was so stupid to be affected, even slightly, that selfrespect prevented my turning around. I had then found the second packet I needed and was about to lay my hand on the third when a long and painful sigh, uttered just over my shoulder, made me bound like a madman from my seat and land several feet away. As I jumped I had turned about, my hand on the hilt of my sword, and, truly, had I not felt it at my side, I should have taken to my heels like a coward.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tall woman, dressed in white, stood gazing at me from the back of the chair where I had been sitting an instant before.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a shudder ran through all my limbs that I nearly fell backward. No one can understand unless he has felt it, that frightful, unreasoning terror! The mind becomes vague; the heart ceases to beat; the entire body grows as limp as a sponge, as if one&#39;s life were ebbing away.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not believe in ghosts, nevertheless I completely gave way to a hideous fear of the dead; and I suffered more in those few moments than in all the rest of my life, from the irresistible anguish of supernatural fright. If she had not spoken, I should have died, perhaps! But she spoke, she spoke in a sweet, sad voice, that set my nerves vibrating. I dare not say that I became master of myself and recovered my reason. No! I was so frightened that I scarcely knew what I was doing; but a certain innate pride, a remnant of soldierly instinct, made me, almost in spite of myself, maintain a creditable countenance. I was posing to myself, I suppose, and to her, whoever she was, woman or ghost. Afterwards I realized all this, for I assure you that, at the time of the apparition, I thought of nothing. I was afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;She said: &quot;Oh! sir, you can render me a great service.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;I tried to reply, but it was impossible for me to pronounce a word. Only a vague sound came from my throat.</p>
<p>&quot;She continued: &#39;Will you? You can save me, cure me. I suffer frightfully. I suffer, oh! how I suffer!&#39; and she slowly seated herself in my arm-chair. &quot;Will you?&#39; she said, looking at me.</p>
<p>&quot;I replied &#39;Yes&#39; by a nod, my voice still being paralysed.</p>
<p>&quot;Then she held out to me a tortoise-shell comb, and murmured:</p>
<p>&quot;Comb my hair, oh! comb my hair; that will cure me; it must be combed. Look at my head how I suffer; and my hair hurts me so!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Her hair, unbound, very long and very black, it seemed to me, hung over the back of the chair and touched the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did I receive that comb with a shudder, and why did I take in my hands the long, black hair which gave to my skin a gruesome, cold sensation, as though I were handling snakes? I cannot tell.</p>
<p>&quot;That sensation has remained in my fingers and I still tremble when I think of it.</p>
<p>&quot;I combed her hair. I handled, I know not how, those icy locks. I twisted, knotted, and loosened them. She sighed and bowed her head, seeming to be happy. Suddenly she said: &quot;Thank you!&#39; snatched the comb from my hands, and fled by the door that I had noticed ajar.</p>
<p>&quot;Left alone, I experienced for several seconds the frightened agitation of one who awakens from a nightmare. At length I regained my full senses; I ran to the window, and with a mighty effort burst open the shutters, letting a flood of light into the room. Immediately I sprang to the door by which she had departed. I found it closed and immovable! &quot;Then a mad desire to flee came on me like a panic, the panic which soldiers know in battle. seized the three packets of letters on the open desk; ran from the room, dashed down the stairs four steps at a time, found myself outside, I know not how, and seeing my horse a few steps off, leaped into the saddle and galloped away.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>&quot;I stopped only when I reached Rouen and my own house. Throwing the bridle to my orderly, I fled to my room, where I shut myself in to think.</p>
<p>&quot;For an hour I anxiously wondered whether I had not been the victim of a hallucination. Surely I had had one of those incomprehensible nervous shocks, one of those mental frights which give rise to miracles, to which the Supernatural owes its power.</p>
<p>&quot;I was about to believe I had seen a vision, had a hallucination, when I approached the window. My eyes fell, by chance, upon my breast. My military cape was covered with hairs; the long hairs of a woman, which had got caught in the buttons! One by one, with trembling fingers, I plucked them off and threw them away.</p>
<p>&quot;I then called my orderly. I was too disturbed, too upset to go and see my friend that day, and I also wished to reflect more fully upon what I ought to tell him. I sent him his letters, for which he gave the soldier a receipt. He asked after me most particularly. He was told I was ill, that I had had sunstroke or something. He seemed to be exceedingly anxious. Next morning at dawn I went to him, determined to tell him the truth. He had gone out the evening before and had not yet returned. I called again during the day; my friend was still absent. I waited for a week. He did not appear. Then I notified the authorities. A search was instituted, but not the slightest trace of his whereabouts or manner of disappearance was discovered.</p>
<p>&quot;A minute inspection was made of the abandoned ch&#226;teau. Nothing of a suspicious character was discovered. There was no indication that a woman had been concealed there.</p>
<p>&quot;The inquiry led to nothing, and the search was stopped, and for fifty-six years I have heard nothing; I know no more than before.&#39;</p>
